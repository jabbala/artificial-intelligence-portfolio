### Finding Shortest Paths on a Planet using Genetic Algorithm

The primary objective of this project is to build a pathfinding system that uses a Genetic Algorithm to find the shortest path between different locations on a planet. Genetic algorithms are inspired by natural evolution and involve generating multiple potential solutions (individuals), selecting the best ones through fitness evaluation, and iteratively improving the population over generations.

Our Genetic Algorithm will create and refine potential paths to find the optimal route for travel between locations.

The Shortest Path Finding project using Genetic Algorithm showcases the power of evolutionary algorithms in solving optimization problems. By mimicking the principles of natural selection and genetic inheritance, the Genetic Algorithm discovers the shortest paths between locations on a planet's surface.

### Solving The Maze Problem using Q-learning

The maze problem involves a grid-like environment where an agent needs to find the optimal path from a start location to a goal location while avoiding obstacles.

Traditional pathfinding algorithms might not work well in complex scenarios, so we turn to Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning technique, to enable the agent to learn the best actions to take in order to reach the goal while avoiding obstacles.

#### Q-Learning Explanation

Q-Learning involves learning a Q-value table that represents the expected rewards for taking different actions in different states. In our case, states are the positions within the maze, and actions are the agent's movements (up, down, left, right).

The agent updates Q-values using the Bellman equation, which takes into account the immediate reward and the expected future rewards.

The "Solving the Maze Problem using Q-Learning" project demonstrates how AI can be used to solve complex pathfinding challenges through reinforcement learning. By allowing the agent to learn from trial and error, we enable it to make intelligent decisions and efficiently navigate through mazes.

### AI Agent for Classic Snake Game using Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN)

The classic Snake game poses a challenge of navigating a snake through a grid while collecting food. Deep Convolutional Q-Learning combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with Q-Learning to create an AI agent that learns both the game's state representation and optimal actions.

The agent leverages the spatial understanding capabilities of CNNs to handle complex scenarios.

#### Deep Convolutional Q-Learning Explanation

Deep Convolutional Q-Learning enhances traditional Q-Learning by using CNNs to approximate Q-values. The CNN takes the game screen as input and outputs Q-values for each possible action. This approach enables the agent to learn spatial patterns in the game environment and make informed decisions.
